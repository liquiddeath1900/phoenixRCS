                <h2>Unique Restoration Challenges in College Park</h2>
                <p>College Park's university environment creates specific restoration challenges that require specialized experience:</p>
                
                <h3>🏢 High-Occupancy Buildings</h3>
                <p>Student housing and apartment complexes require coordinated restoration efforts that minimize disruption to residents while ensuring thorough restoration. We have experience working with property managers and university officials.</p>
                
                <h3>📚 Academic Calendar Considerations</h3>
                <p>Timing restoration work around the university calendar is often critical. We understand the importance of completing work during breaks or scheduling around academic activities.</p>
                
                <h3>🍳 Kitchen Fire Frequency</h3>
                <p>Student housing and nearby apartments experience higher rates of kitchen fires. Our team is experienced in smoke damage cleanup and odor elimination in multi-unit buildings.</p>
                
                <h3>💧 Plumbing System Stress</h3>
                <p>High-occupancy buildings put stress on plumbing systems, leading to more frequent water damage events. We respond quickly to prevent damage spread in connected units.</p>
                
                <h3>🌡️ HVAC and Mold Issues</h3>
                <p>Large HVAC systems serving multiple units can spread moisture and create mold problems. Our EPA certified specialists handle complex mold situations in shared air systems.</p>
