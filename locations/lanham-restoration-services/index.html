                <h2>Common Restoration Challenges in Lanham, MD</h2>
                <p>Our local experience in Lanham has taught us about the specific restoration challenges facing our community:</p>
                
                <h3>üåä Basement Flooding Issues</h3>
                <p>Lanham's location and soil conditions can lead to basement flooding during heavy rains. Many homes in the area have older drainage systems that can become overwhelmed. Our team knows which neighborhoods are most susceptible and responds with specialized basement drying equipment.</p>
                
                <h3>üè† Aging Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>Many Lanham properties have aging plumbing and electrical systems that can fail unexpectedly. Water line breaks and electrical fires require immediate professional response. Our local presence means we can respond before small problems become major disasters.</p>
                
                <h3>üå°Ô∏è Humidity and Mold</h3>
                <p>Maryland's humid climate, combined with Lanham's location in Prince George's County, creates ideal conditions for mold growth. We regularly help Lanham homeowners with mold prevention and remediation, especially in basements and crawl spaces.</p>
                
                <h3>‚õàÔ∏è Severe Weather</h3>
                <p>Lanham experiences severe thunderstorms, high winds, and occasional winter storms. Our local team is always ready for weather emergencies, with equipment pre-positioned and response plans activated when severe weather threatens.</p>
